## Debugging

The app includes comprehensive API logging using Apple's unified logging system (OSLog). To view logs:

1. **In Xcode Console:**
   - Run the app from Xcode
   - View logs in the console at the bottom

2. **In Console.app:**
   - Open Console.app on your Mac
   - Connect your device
   - Filter by process name: "Komga" or subsystem: "Komga"
   - Category: "API"

**Log Format:**
```
📡 GET https://your-server.com/api/v2/users/me
✅ 200 GET https://your-server.com/api/v2/users/me (45.67ms)
📡 GET https://your-server.com/api/v1/series/123/thumbnail [Data]
✅ 200 GET https://your-server.com/api/v1/series/123/thumbnail (123.45ms, 245 KB)
```

**Log Symbols:**
- 📡 Request sent
- ✅ Successful response (200-299)
- ❌ Error response (400+) or network error
- 🔒 Unauthorized (401)
- ⚠️ Warning (e.g., empty response)

**Detailed Error Information:**

When a decoding error occurs, the log will show:
- Missing keys and their paths
- Type mismatches
- Value not found errors
- First 1000 characters of the response data for debugging

This helps quickly identify API compatibility issues between different Komga versions.

## TODO

- [x] Option to disable titles in library view (most are too long to show more than a few characters)
- [x] Option to preserve the cover image aspect ratio in the library view (a lot of cover images are not standardized in resolutions)

### Series & Book Features
