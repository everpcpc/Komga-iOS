    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

    <p>
      KMReader respects your privacy. This privacy policy explains how we handle
      your information when you use the KMReader app.
    </p>

    <h3>Information Collection</h3>

    <p>
      KMReader does not collect, transmit, or store any personal information or
      user data. All data related to your usage of the app, including
      authentication credentials, reading progress, and cached content, is
      stored locally on your device only.
    </p>

    <h3>Local Data Storage</h3>

    <p>
      To provide you with a better user experience, KMReader stores the
      following information locally on your device:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Server URL and authentication credentials</li>
      <li>Cached images and content for offline access</li>
      <li>App preferences and settings</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      All of this data remains on your device and is never transmitted to any
      external servers or third parties. We do not have access to any of this
      information.
    </p>

    <h3>Server Connection</h3>

    <p>
      KMReader connects directly to your Komga server instance. All
      communication occurs between your device and your server. We do not
      intercept, monitor, or store any data transmitted between your app and
      your server.
    </p>

    <h3>Third-Party Services</h3>

    <p>
      KMReader does not use any third-party analytics, advertising, or tracking
      services. The app does not include any code that would collect or transmit
      your personal information.
    </p>

    <h3>Data Deletion</h3>

    <p>
      Since all data is stored locally on your device, you can delete all
      information associated with KMReader by uninstalling the app. To ensure
      complete removal of authentication credentials stored in Keychain, you may
      need to log out from within the app before uninstalling.
    </p>

    <h3>Changes to This Policy</h3>

    <p>
      We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Any changes will be
      posted on this page. We encourage you to review this policy periodically.
    </p>

    <h3>Contact</h3>

    <p>
      If you have any questions about this privacy policy, please contact us
      through the project's GitHub repository.
