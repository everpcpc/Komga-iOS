          <article class="faq-item">
            <h4>Is KMReader an official Komga app?</h4>
            <p>
              No. KMReader is a community-built open-source client that talks to
              the public Komga APIs. It is designed to feel as polished as a
              first-party experience, but it is not affiliated with the Komga
              project.
            </p>
          </article>
          <article class="faq-item">
            <h4>Can I connect to multiple Komga servers?</h4>
            <p>
              Yes. Save as many Komga servers as you like with custom names,
              switch between them instantly, and manage credentials or cache per
              server when needed.
            </p>
          </article>
          <article class="faq-item">
            <h4>What formats can I read?</h4>
            <p>
              Comics and manga (DIVINA) are fully supported on all platforms
              (iOS, iPadOS, macOS, tvOS). EPUB books are supported on
              iOS/iPadOS/macOS. The comic reader handles every direction,
              layout, and gesture you expect, while EPUB brings theme, font, and
              pagination controls with an optional comic-style image boost for
              illustrated stories. tvOS supports DIVINA reading with remote
              control navigation.

          <article class="faq-item">
            <h4>Do I have to re-download books to read offline?</h4>
            <p>
              No. KMReader's three-tier caching system (pages, book files,
              thumbnails) automatically caches recently opened pages and
              downloads EPUB files for offline or incognito reading. Adjustable
              page cache limits, real-time cache size and file count monitoring
              for each cache type, and individual cache clearing in Settings.
              Automatic cleanup occurs when limits are exceeded.

          <article class="faq-item">
            <h4>Can administrators manage the Komga server?</h4>
            <p>
              Yes. With admin permissions, KMReader unlocks metadata editing,
              library upkeep, maintenance jobs, and quick server insights
              directly on your device.
            </p>

          <article class="faq-item">
            <h4>How do updates ship?</h4>
            <p>

              from GitHub, rebuild in Xcode, and you&rsquo;re ready to go. You
