HIGHLIGHTS

• Guided Onboarding & Multi-Server Vault: The first launch walks you directly into server setup, then remembers every Komga instance with custom names, roles, and last-used info. Switch accounts instantly, review authentication history, and clear cached data automatically when removing a server.
• Unified Library & Dashboard: Browse Series, Books, Collections, and Read Lists with advanced search and filtering while personalized sections like Keep Reading, On Deck, and Recently Added keep your next read ready. History stays in sync so you can resume from any device.
• Dual-Format Readers: Enjoy a comic reader built for LTR/RTL/vertical/Webtoon styles with dual-page spreads, pinch zoom, tap zones, page jumps, and page exports. The EPUB reader keeps entire books available for offline or incognito sessions with adjustable fonts, themes, pagination, and an option to view compatible titles like comics.
• Admin & Monitoring Tools: Edit metadata, manage read lists, run scans or analyses per library or across all libraries, and review server info plus easy-to-read metrics without leaving the couch.
• Smart Caching & Offline Access: Page, book, and thumbnail caches load everything instantly while respecting storage. Check live usage, clear individual caches when needed, and rely on saved content when you’re offline.
• Native Apple Experience: Optimized layouts for iPhone, iPad, and Mac include a dedicated reader window on macOS, rich keyboard shortcuts, customizable theme colors and column counts, adjustable Webtoon width, and incognito reading across both reader engines.
