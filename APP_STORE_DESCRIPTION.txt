HIGHLIGHTS

• Guided Onboarding & Multi-Server Vault: The first launch walks you directly into server setup, then remembers every Komga instance with custom names, roles, and last-used info. Switch accounts instantly, review authentication history with IP/User-Agent/API key metadata, and clear cached data automatically when removing a server. Role-based access control automatically unlocks admin-only tools.

• Unified Library & Dashboard: Browse Series, Books, Collections, and Read Lists with advanced search and filtering while personalized sections like Keep Reading, On Deck, Recently Added Books, Recently Read Books, Recently Released Books, Recently Added Series, and Recently Updated Series keep your next read ready. Customize which sections appear, reorder them to match your workflow, and filter dashboard content by specific libraries. History stays in sync so you can resume from any device with infinite scroll and library filtering.

• Dual-Format Readers: Enjoy a comic reader built for LTR/RTL/vertical/Webtoon styles (Webtoon on iOS/iPadOS only) with dual-page spreads, pinch zoom (iOS/iPadOS/macOS), customizable tap zones, page jumps with visual counter, and page exports in multiple formats (JPEG, PNG, HEIF, WebP). The EPUB reader (iOS/iPadOS/macOS) keeps entire books available for offline or incognito sessions with adjustable fonts, themes (system/light/sepia/dark), pagination modes, column layouts, and an optional image-view mode for comic-style rendering. tvOS supports DIVINA comic reading with remote control navigation.

• Admin & Monitoring Tools: Edit metadata, manage collections and read lists, run scans or analyses per library or across all libraries (with multi-select support), and review server info plus easy-to-read metrics dashboard with disk usage, task analytics, and per-library drill-downs. Task analytics show executed tasks and total time by type with inline error messages, plus cancel-all functionality. Library management includes name confirmation for deletions and comprehensive metrics—all without leaving the couch. Real-time updates via Server-Sent Events (SSE) keep your library synchronized instantly when content changes, with live task queue status, thumbnail generation progress, session expiration alerts, and automatic reconnection. Toggle SSE on or off with optional connection status and task completion notifications from a dedicated settings page.

• Smart Caching & Offline Access: Three-tier caching system (pages, book files, thumbnails) loads everything instantly while respecting storage. Adjustable page cache limits (512MB-8GB), real-time cache size and file count monitoring, individual cache clearing, and automatic cleanup when limits are exceeded. Access recently viewed pages and downloaded EPUB files when offline.

• Native Apple Experience: Optimized layouts for iPhone, iPad, Mac, and Apple TV include a dedicated reader window on macOS, rich keyboard shortcuts (including improved macOS shortcuts), customizable theme colors and orientation-aware column counts, adjustable Webtoon width (iOS/iPadOS), tap zone hints, and incognito reading across both reader engines. tvOS features focus-based navigation optimized for remote control. Dashboard customization lets you show, hide, and reorder sections plus filter by libraries.
